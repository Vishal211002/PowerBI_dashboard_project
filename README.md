Solution:


Customer Analysis

3. From the report it is observed that maximum quantity purchased for different customer segments is approximately 100 times average order size.
It means that average order size needs to be increased by incorporating low-end customers to increase their purchasing power by providing them
suitable offers and discounts.
   
Operational Analysis

2. From the report it is observed that average shipping time is 5 days. A little decrease in shipping time is recommended to increase customer 
attraction. Fast and efficient delivery would definitely increases customer satisfaction and  purchasing power.

Geographical Analysis

3. Geographical factors such as undeveloped countries having inefficient distribution channels due to poor transport system and unmanageable
delivery system would decreases the sales performance to a greater extent. From the report it is observed that sales performance is low in
Africa while Australia and India would greatly increases the sales performance.
